StockRun
========

StockRun is a 3D game developed with Unity’s game engine which takes stock market prices using Bloomberg’s APIs and generates an adventure maps to be completed by the user. The game fetches stock market prices of particular indexes and proceeds to generate the map. 
It uses Java to fetch the data from the Bloomberg Terminal and C# for the game mechanics.

StockRun was created during GUTS Hackathon 2014.
